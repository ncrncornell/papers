  Abstract                 = {Recent years have shown the power of user-sourced information evidenced by the success of Wikipedia and its many emulators. This sort of unstructured discussion is currently not feasible as a part of the otherwise successful metadata repositories. Creating and augmenting metadata is a labor-intensive endeavor. Harnessing collective knowledge from actual data users can supplement officially generated metadata. As part of our Comprehensive Extensible Data Documentation and Access Repository (CED2AR) infrastructure, we demonstrate a prototype of crowdsourced DDI, using DDI-C and supplemental XML. The system allows for any number of network connected instances (web or desktop deployments) of the CED2AR DDI editor to concurrently create and modify metadata. The backend transparently handles changes, and frontend has the ability to separate official edits (by designated curators of the data and the metadata) from crowd-sourced content. We briefly discuss offline edit contributions as well. CED2AR uses DDI-C and supplemental XML together with Git for a very portable and lightweight implementation. This distributed network implementation allows for large scale metadata curation without the need for a hardware intensive computing environment, and can leverage existing cloud services, such as Github or Bitbucket.},

  Abstract                 = {The Comprehensive Extensible Data Documentation and Access Repository (CED2AR), is an online repository for metadata on surveys, administrative microdata, and other statistical information. CED2AR runs directly from DDI 2.5 through a single, non-relational database. While the DDI schema is well developed for documentation purposes, it is not ideal for semantic web applications. Using the schema.org microdata markup, CED2AR allows search engines to parse semantic information from DDI. The solution further enhances the discoverability of DDI metadata, as the data are machine readable to several providers such as Google, Yahoo and Bing. The schema.org markup is not directly embedded within the DDI, so it doesn't directly export when a user downloads a codebook. However, CED2AR can also run as a zero install desktop application. Users can simply download their own copy of CED2AR, quickly import codebooks, and instantly see the schema.org enhancements the system offers. The only prerequisites for the software is Java version 7, and an internet browser. This presentation will demonstrate the advantages schema.org adds to DDI, and the ease of deployment CED2AR allows.},

abstract={International comparison studies on economic activity are often hampered by the fact that access to business microdata is very limited on an international level. A recently launched project tries to overcome these limitations by improving access to Business Censuses from multiple countries based on synthetic data. Starting from the synthetic version of the longitudinally edited version of the U.S. Business Register (the Longitudinal Business Database, LBD), the idea is to create similar data products in other countries by applying the synthesis methodology developed for the LBD to generate synthetic replicates that could be distributed without confidentiality concerns. In this paper we present some first results of this project based on German business data collected at the Institute for Employment Research.}
