Provenance has become even more critical in the web environment in which data from distributed sources and of varying integrity can be combined and derived.

In this paper, we develop a simple \textbf{one permutation hashing} scheme to address this important issue. While it is true that the preprocessing step can be parallelized, it comes at the cost of additional hardware and implementation. Also, reducing k permutations to just one would be much more \textbf{energy-efficient}, which might be an important perspective as minwise hashing is commonly deployed in the search industry. While the theoretical probability analysis is interesting, our experiments on similarity estimation and SVM \& logistic regression also confirm the theoretical results.},

  Abstract		={Minwise hashing is a standard technique for efficient set similarity estimation in the context of search. The recent work of b-bit minwise hashing provided a substantial improvement by storing only the lowest b bits of each hashed value. Both minwise hashing and b-bit minwise hashing require an expensive preprocessing step for applying k (e.g., k=500) permutations on the entire data in order to compute k minimal values as the hashed data. In this paper, we developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs, which reduced the processing time by a factor of 20-80. Reducing the preprocessing time is highly beneficial in practice, for example, for duplicate web page detection (where minwise hashing is a major step in the crawling pipeline) or for increasing the testing speed of online classifiers (when the test data are not preprocessed).},

  abstract  = {Minwise hashing is a standard technique in the context of search for approximating set similarities. The recent work [26, 32] demonstrated a potential use of b-bit minwise hashing [23, 24] for efficient search and learning on massive, high-dimensional, binary data (which are typical for many applications in Web search and text mining). In this paper, we focus on a number of critical issues which must be addressed before one can apply b-bit minwise hashing to the volumes of data often used industrial applications. Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that computes k (e.g., 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding permutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of 20 ~ 80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. Reducing the preprocessing time is highly beneficial in practice, e.g., for duplicate Web page detection (where minwise hashing is a major step in the crawling pipeline) or for increasing the testing speed of online classifiers. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomes impossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix, due to its
space requirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that b-bit minwise hashing implemented using simple hash functions, e.g., the 2-universal (2U) and 4-universal (4U) hash families, can produce very similar learning results as using fully random permutations. Experiments on datasets of up to 200GB are presented.},

For nonnegative data streams, the method of Compressed Counting (CC) based on maximally-skewed stable random projections can provide accurate estimates of the Shannon entropy using small storage. However, CC is no longer applicable when entries of data streams can be below zero, which is a common scenario when comparing two streams. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for entropy estimation in general data streams which allow negative entries. In our method, the Shannon entropy is approximated by the finite difference of two correlated frequency moments estimated from correlated samples of symmetric stable random variables. Our experiments confirm that this method is able to substantially better approximate the Shannon entropy compared to the prior state-of-the-art.},

  Abstract		={Many applications (e.g., anomaly detection) concern sparse signals. This paper focuses on the problem of recovering a K-sparse signal x â R/1ÃN, i.e., K << N and âN/i=1 1{xi â  0} = K. In the mainstream framework of compressed sensing (CS), Ã is recovered from M linear measurements y = xS â R/1ÃM, where S â RNÃM is often a Gaussian (or Gaussian-like) design matrix.

In our proposed method, the design matrix S is generated from an Î±-stable distribution with Î± â 0. Our decoding algorithm mainly requires one linear scan of the coordinates, followed by a few iterations on a small number of coordinates which are "undetermined" in the previous iteration. Our practical algorithm consists of two estimators. In the first iteration, the (absolute) minimum estimator is able to filter out a majority of the zero coordinates. The gap estimator, which is applied in each iteration, can accurately recover the magnitudes of the nonzero coordinates. Comparisons with linear programming (LP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) demonstrate that our algorithm can be significantly faster in decoding speed and more accurate in recovery quality, for the task of exact spare recovery. Our procedure is robust against measurement noise. Even when there are no sufficient measurements, our algorithm can still reliably recover a significant portion of the nonzero coordinates.},

The proposed functional representation is a graph invariant, i.e., the functional remains unchanged under any reordering of the vertices. This property eliminates the difficulty of handling exponentially many isomorphic forms. Bhattacharyya kernel constructed between these functionals significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art graph kernels on 3 out of the 4 standard benchmark graph classification datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our approach. The proposed methodology is simple and runs in time linear in the number of edges, which makes our kernel more efficient and scalable compared to many widely adopted graph kernels with running time cubic in the number of vertices.},

  abstract  = {MinHash and SimHash are the two widely adopted Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithms for large-scale data processing applications. Deciding which LSH to use for a particular problem at hand is an important question, which has no clear answer in the existing literature. In this study, we provide a theoretical answer (validated by experiments) that MinHash virtually always outperforms SimHash when the data are binary, as common in practice such as search. The collision probability of MinHash is a function of resemblance similarity (R), while the collision probability of SimHash is a function of cosine similarity (S). To provide a common basis for comparison, we evaluate retrieval results in terms of S for both MinHash and SimHash. This evaluation is valid as we can prove that MinHash is a valid LSH with respect to S, by using a general inequality S2â¤Râ¤S2âS. Our worst case analysis can show that MinHash significantly outperforms SimHash in high similarity region. Interestingly, our intensive experiments reveal that MinHash is also substantially better than SimHash even in datasets where most of the data points are not too similar to each other. This is partly because, in practical data, often Râ¥SzâS holds where z is only slightly larger than 2 (e.g., zâ¤2.1). Our restricted worst case analysis by assuming SzâSâ¤Râ¤S2âS shows that MinHash indeed significantly outperforms SimHash even in low similarity region. We believe the results in this paper will provide valuable guidelines for search in practice, especially when the data are sparse.},

Our proposed test is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between an empirical cumulative hazard function and its best approximation from the class of distributions constituting the null hypothesis. It turns out that the least favorable distribution, which produces the largest probability of Type I error of each of the tests, is the exponential distribution. This fact is used to produce an appropriate cut-off or p-value. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to check small sample size (i.e., significance) and power of the test. Usefulness of the test is illustrated through the analysis of a set of monthly family expenditure data collected by the National Sample Survey Organization of the Government of India.},

  Abstract		={In this paper, we explore the use of a novel online multi-task learning framework for the task of search query spelling correction. In our procedure, correction candidates are initially generated by a ranker-based system and then re-ranked by our multi-task learning algorithm. With the proposed multi-task learning method, we are able to effectively transfer information from different and highly biased training datasets, for improving spelling correction on all datasets. Our experiments are conducted on three query spelling correction datasets including the well-known TREC benchmark dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method considerably outperforms the existing baseline systems in terms of accuracy. Importantly, the proposed method is about one order of magnitude faster than baseline systems in terms of training speed. Compared to the commonly used online learning methods which typically require more than (e.g.,) 60 training passes, our proposed method is able to closely reach the empirical optimum in about 5 passes.},

We first review the concepts of statistical disclosure limitation for an audience of economists who may be unfamiliar with these methods. Our main objective is to shed light on the effects of statistical disclosure limitation for empirical economic research. In general, the standard approach of ignoring statistical disclosure limitation leads to incorrect inference. We formalize statistical disclosure methods in a model of the data publication process. In the model, the statistical agency collects data from a population, but published a version of the data that have been intentionally distorted. The model allows us to characterize what it means for statistical disclosure limitation to be ignorable, and to characterize what happens when it is not. We then consider the effects of statistical disclosure limitation for regression analysis, instrumental variable analysis, and regression discontinuity design. Because statistical agencies do not always report the methods they use to protect confidentiality, we use our model to characterize settings in which statistical disclosure limitation methods are discoverable; that is, they can be learned from the released data. We conclude with advice for researchers, journal editors, and statistical agencies.},

They balance the trade-off between protection of confidentiality and quality of inference. Recent developments in disclosure avoidance techniques include the incorporation of synthetic data, which capture the essential features of underlying data by releasing altered data generated from a posterior predictive distribution. The US Census Bureau collects millions of interrelated time series microdata that are hierarchical and contain many 0s and suppressions. Rule-based disclosure avoidance techniques often require the suppression of count data for small magnitudes and the modification of data based on a small number of entities. Motivated by this problem, we use zero-inflated extensions of Bayesian generalized linear mixed models with privacy-preserving prior distributions to develop methods for protecting and releasing synthetic data from time series about thousands of small groups of entities without suppression based on the magnitudes or number of entities. We find that, as the prior distributions of the variance components in the Bayesian generalized linear mixed model become more precise towards zero, protection of confidentiality increases and the quality of inference deteriorates. We evaluate our methodology by using a strict privacy measure, empirical differential privacy and a newly defined risk measure, the probability of range identification, which directly measures attribute disclosure risk. We illustrate our results with the US Census Bureau's quarterly workforce indicators.},

Sensitive data are currently protected through suppression. However, as additional tabulations are being developed, at ever more detailed geographic levels, the number of suppressions increases dramatically. This paper explores the option of providing public-use data that are analytically valid and without suppressions, by leveraging synthetic data to replace observations in sensitive cells.}

First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax the exogenous mobility assumptions by modeling the evolution of the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent class framework. Our results suggest that endogenous mobility biases estimated firm effects toward zero. To assess validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker. The corrected estimates attribute much more of the variation in revenue per worker to variation in match quality and worker quality than the uncorrected estimates.},

We first consider the implications of adding the public-good component to recently published models of private data publication under differential privacy guarantees using a Vickery-Clark-Groves mechanism and a Lindahl mechanism. We show that data quality will be inefficiently under-supplied. Next, we develop a standard social planner?s problem using the technology set implied by (?, ?)-differential privacy with (?, ?)-accuracy for the Private Multiplicative Weights query release mechanism to study the properties of optimal provision of data accuracy and privacy loss when both are public goods. Using the production possibilities frontier implied by this technology, explicitly parameterized interdependent preferences, and the social welfare function, we display properties of the solution to the social planner?s problem. Our results directly quantify the optimal choice of data accuracy and privacy loss as functions of the technology and preference parameters. Some of these properties can be quantified using population statistics on marginal preferences and correlations between income, data accuracy preferences, and privacy loss preferences that are available from survey data. Our results show that government data custodians should publish more accurate statistics with weaker privacy guarantees than would occur with purely private data publishing. Our statistical results using the General Social Survey and the Cornell National Social Survey indicate that the welfare losses from under-providing data accuracy while over-providing privacy protection can be substantial.},

The privacy of both individuals and business establishments that feature in these data are protected by law in most countries. These data are currently released using a variety of statistical disclosure limitation (SDL) techniques that do not reveal the exact characteristics of particular employers and employees, but lack provable privacy guarantees limiting inferential disclosures.
	In this work, we present novel algorithms for releasing tabular summaries of linked ER-EE data with formal, provable guarantees of privacy. We show that state-of-the-art differentially private algorithms add too much noise for the output to be useful. Instead, we identify the privacy requirements mandated by current interpretations of the relevant laws, and formalize them using the Pufferfish framework. We then develop new privacy definitions that are customized to ER-EE data and satisfy the statutory privacy requirements. We implement the experiments in this paper on production data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau. An empirical evaluation of utility for these data shows that for reasonable values of the privacy-loss parameter $\epsilon\geq$ 1, the additive error introduced by our provably private algorithms is comparable, and in some cases better, than the error introduced by existing SDL techniques that have no provable privacy guarantees. For some complex queries currently published, however, our algorithms do not have utility comparable to the existing traditional SDL algorithms. Those queries are fodder for future research.},

We show that the trends in earnings inequality in the administrative data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program are inconsistent with other data sources when we do not correct for the presence of misused SSNs. After this correction to the worker frame, we analyze how the earnings distribution has changed in the last decade. We present a decomposition of the year-to-year changes in the earnings distribution from 2004-2013. Even when simplifying these flows to movements between the bottom 20\%, the middle 60\% and the top 20\% of the earnings distribution, about 20.5 million workers undergo a transition each year. Another 19.9 million move between employment and nonemployment. To understand the role of the firm in these transitions, we estimate a model for log earnings with additive fixed worker and firm effects using all jobs held by eligible workers from 2004-2013. We construct a composite log earnings firm component across all jobs for a worker in a given year and a non-firm component. We also construct a skill-type index. We show that, while the difference between working at a low- or middle-paying firm are relatively small, the gains from working at a top-paying firm are large. Specifically, the benefits of working for a high-paying firm are not only realized today, through higher earnings paid to the worker, but also persist through an increase in the probability of upward mobility. High-paying firms facilitate moving workers to the top of the earnings distribution and keeping them there.},

Recognizing this as a resource allocation problem, we propose an economic solution: operate where the marginal cost of increasing privacy equals the marginal benefit. Our model of production, from computer science, assumes data are published using an efficient differentially private algorithm. Optimal choice weighs the demand for accurate statistics against the demand for privacy. Examples from U.S. statistical programs show how our framework can guide decision-making.

The privacy of both individuals and business establishments that feature in these data are protected by law in most countries. These data are currently released using a variety of statistical disclosure limitation (SDL) techniques that do not reveal the exact characteristics of particular employers and employees, but lack provable privacy guarantees limiting inferential disclosures.

In this work, we present novel algorithms for releasing tabular summaries of linked ER-EE data with formal, provable guarantees of privacy. We show that state-of-the-art differentially private algorithms add too much noise for the output to be useful. Instead, we identify the privacy requirements mandated by current interpretations of the relevant laws, and formalize them using the Pufferfish framework. We then develop new privacy definitions that are customized to ER-EE data and satisfy the statutory privacy requirements. We implement the experiments in this paper on production data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau. An empirical evaluation of utility for these data shows that for reasonable values of the privacy-loss parameter Îµ>= 1, the additive error introduced by our provably private algorithms is comparable, and in some cases better, than the error introduced by existing SDL techniques that have no provable privacy guarantees. For some complex queries currently published, however, our algorithms do not have utility comparable to the existing traditional SDL algorithms. Those queries are fodder for future research.},

  abstract    = {These proceedings report on a workshop hosted at the U.S. Census Bureau on May 8, 2017. Our purpose was to gather experts from various backgrounds together to continue discussing the development of formal privacy systems for Census Bureau data products. This workshop was a successor to a previous workshop held in October 2016 (Vilhuber and Schmutte 2017). At our prior workshop, we hosted computer scientists, survey statisticians, and economists, all of whom were experts in data privacy. At that time we discussed the practical implementation of cutting-edge methods for publishing data with formal, provable privacy guarantees, with a focus on applications to Census Bureau data products. The teams developing those applications were just starting out when our first workshop took place, and we spent our time brainstorming solutions to the various problems researchers were encountering, or anticipated encountering. For these cutting-edge formal privacy models, there had been very little effort in the academic literature to apply those methods in real-world settings with large, messy data. We therefore brought together an expanded group of specialists from academia and government who could shed light on technical challenges, subject matter challenges and address how data users might react to changes in data availability and publishing standards.
In May 2017, we organized a follow-up workshop, which these proceedings report on. We reviewed progress made in four different areas. The four topics discussed as part of the workshop were 1. the 2020 Decennial Census; 2. the American Community Survey (ACS); 3. the 2017 Economic Census; 4. measuring the demand for privacy and for data quality.
As in our earlier workshop, our goals were to 1. Discuss the specific challenges that have arisen in ongoing efforts to apply formal privacy models to Census data products by drawing together expertise of academic and governmental researchers; 2. Produce short written memos that summarize concrete suggestions for practical applications to specific Census Bureau priority areas.},

The first example is the linkages in the Health and Retirement Study to Social Security Administration data. The second example is the linkage of the Survey of Income and Program Participation to administrative data from the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration. The third example is the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data, which links state unemployment insurance records for workers and firms to a wide variety of censuses and surveys at the U.S. Census Bureau. For examples, we discuss access modalities, disclosure limitation methods, the effectiveness of those methods, and the resulting analytical validity. The final sections discuss recent advances in access modalities for linked administrative data.},

Beginning-of-quarter employment is also the main tabulation variable in the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) workplace reports as displayed in OnTheMap (OTM). The evaluation is conducted by generating multiple threads of the edit and imputation models used in the LEHD Infrastructure File System. These threads conform to the Rubin (1987) multiple imputation model, with each thread or implicate being the output of formal probability models that address coverage, edit, and imputation errors. Design-based sampling variability and nite population corrections are also included in the evaluation. We derive special formulas for the Rubin total variability and its components that are consistent with the disclosure avoidance system used for QWI and LODES/OTM workplace reports. These formulas allow us to publish the complete set of detailed total quality measures for QWI and LODES. The analysis reveals that the five publication variables under study are estimated very accurately for tabulations involving at least 10 jobs. Tabulations involving three to nine jobs have quality in the range generally deemed acceptable. Tabulations involving zero, one or two jobs, which are generally suppressed in the QWI and synthesized in LODES, have substantial total variability but their publication in LODES allows the formation of larger custom aggregations, which will in general have the accuracy estimated for tabulations in the QWI based on a similar number of workers.},

	abstract={Commuting flows and workplace employment data have a wide constituency of users including urban and regional planners, social science and transportation researchers, and businesses. The U.S. Census Bureau releases two, national data products that give the magnitude and characteristics of home to work flows. The American Community Survey (ACS) tabulates householdsâ responses on employment, workplace, and commuting behavior. The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program tabulates administrative records on jobs in the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES). Design differences across the datasets lead to divergence in a comparable statistic: county-to-county aggregate commute flows. To understand differences in the public use data, this study compares ACS and LEHD source files, using identifying information and probabilistic matching to join person and job records. In our assessment, we compare commuting statistics for job frames linked on person, employment status, employer, and workplace and we identify person and job characteristics as well as design features of the data frames that explain aggregate differences. We find a lower rate of within-county commuting and farther commutes in LODES. We attribute these greater distances to differences in workplace reporting and to uncertainty of establishment assignments in LEHD for workers at multi-unit employers. Minor contributing factors include differences in residence location and ACS workplace edits. The results of this analysis and the data infrastructure developed will support further work to understand and enhance commuting statistics in both datasets.},
