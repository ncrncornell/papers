# Papers by the NCRN Cornell node
All of our papers are accessible through our [eCommons paper repository](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/30503) and/or the [LDI Document repository](https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/ldi/).

Published papers are listed at https://www.ncrn.cornell.edu/publications/.

This repository contains the source materials for some of those papers, as well as the [BibTeX files](bibliography/bib that drive the above websites.

The website uses a [custom plugin](https://github.com/ncrncornell/wp-plugins) to pull information from the eCommons Dspace instance into the website, generating a BibTeX file.
