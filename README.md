# Papers by the NCRN Cornell node
All of our papers are accessible through our [https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/30503](eCommons paper repository) and/or the LDI Document repository. 

Published papers are listed at [https://www.ncrn.cornell.edu/publications/].

This repository contains the source materials for some of those papers, as well as the [bibliography/bib](BibTeX files) that drive the above websites. 

The website uses a [https://github.com/ncrncornell/wp-plugins](custom plugin) to pull information from the eCommons Dspace instance into the website, generating a BibTeX file.
