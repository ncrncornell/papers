  abstract = {There’s been a long, sometimes heated, debate on the role of firm
	size in employment growth. Despite skepticism in the academic community,
	the notion that growth is negatively related to firm size remains
	appealing to policymakers and small business advocates. The widespread
	and repeated claim from this community is that most new jobs are
	created by small businesses. Using data from the Census Bureau Business
	Dynamics Statistics and Longitudinal Business Database, we explore
	the many issues regarding the role of firm size and growth that have
	been at the core of this ongoing debate (such as the role of regression
	to the mean). We find that the relationship between firm size and
	employment growth is sensitive to these issues. However, our main
	finding is that once we control for firm age there is no systematic
	relationship between firm size and growth. Our findings highlight
	the important role of business startups and young businesses in U.S.
	job creation. Business startups contribute substantially to both
	gross and net job creation. In addition, we find an “up or out” dynamic
	of young firms. These findings imply that it is critical to control
	for and understand the role of firm age in explaining U.S. job creation.},

	server also should provide some way for users to check the fit of
	their models, without disclosing actual data values. This paper discusses
	regression diagnostics for remote servers. The proposal is to release
	synthetic diagnostics—i.e. simulated values of residuals and dependent
	and independent variables–constructed to mimic the relationships
	among the real-data residuals and independent variables. Using simulations,
	it is shown that the proposed synthetic diagnostics can reveal model
	inadequacies without substantial increase in the risk of disclosures.
	This approach also can be used to develop remote server diagnostics
	for generalized linear models.},

	into account the dynamics of a statistical database. This paper shows
	that partitioning often will either result in high information loss
