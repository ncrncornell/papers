We develop the core of a method for solving the data archive and curation problem that confronts the 
custodians of restricted-access research data and the scientific users of such data. 
Our solution recognizes the dual protections afforded by physical security and access limitation protocols.
It is based on extensible tools and can be easily incorporated into existing instructional materials.
