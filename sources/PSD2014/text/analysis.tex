We implemented Algorithm~1 for \ac{BDS} tabulations by establishment age and size ({\tt bds\_e\_agesz}). As noted in Table~\ref{tab:bds_e}, about 26\% of all cells have some suppression. For this version of the paper, we analyzed a single variable, ``Job Creation by establishment births'' ({\tt job\_creation\_births}). (Additional analyses are pending release). 

\subsection{Extent of protection}
\label{sec:protection}
\input{protection}
Protection of the table relies in large part on the fact that the data replacing the suppressions is 
itself synthetic, and released (in the case of the examples in this paper) or (potentially) 
releasable (for tabulations with geography) to a broad audience \cite{AbowdVilhuber2010}. No 
establishment's observed data is released in the SynLBD, and only the industry distribution of 
establishments is preserved exactly. However, in order to consider a broader notion of 
disclosure avoidance, we proceed as follows. In cell that would have been suppressed under 
the current regime \textbf{BDS$^{0}$},  we compute the difference between the confidential 
values of the establishments contributing to this cell, and each of the values of the synthetic 
establishments contributing to the cell under \textbf{BDS$^{(i)}$}, and assess the distribution of 
these differences.%
\footnote{As of June 2014, this distribution had not been released.}
%In order to describe the protection provided  by the protection mechanism described in 
%Section~\ref{sec:synthetic_method}, Table~TBD provides a 
%transition matrix for small values of the (confidential) $X_{k^\prime t}$ against $X_{k^\prime 
%t}^{s}$, $X_{k^\prime t}^{(i)}$, and 
%$X_{k^\prime t}^{(ii)}$, for several variables of interest (establishment births and deaths, job 
%creation and destruction, employment levels). (Table~TBD is being computed and/or pending 
%release at the time of submission of this document).

\subsection{Analytical validity}
\label{sec:validity}
In order to assess the analytical validity of each of the methods, we focus on simple time-series 
properties of  the $X_{k^\prime t}$. In particular, we estimate a AR(2) process for each of 
$X_{k^\prime t}$, $X_{k^\prime t}^{s}$, and $X_{k^\prime t}^{(i)}$. % and $X_{k^\prime t}^{(ii)}$,  
We then assess the number of missing time-series estimates (repeated suppressions in 
$X_{k^\prime t}^{s}$ may lead to time-series that are too short), the number of significant 
coefficients for the first lag of the AR(2),  estimated from both the confidential data ($\rho_1$) 
and the comparison data ($\rho_1^{s}$ and $\rho_1^{(i)}$), and finally two measures of utility: 
\emph{coverage}, the 
percentage of regressions where the true $\rho_1$ lies within the confidence band around the 
coefficient estimated from the comparison $\rho_1^{s}$ and $\rho_1^{(i)}$, and  the interval 
overlap measure $J_k$ as suggested by \cite{tas2006}.

(Caveat: different definitions of ``job creation births'' in the BDS processing and our 
post-processing lead to incomplete filling in of missing cells. This will be fixed in later work.) For 
the one variable that has significant suppressions, the number of feasible regressions in the 
published data increases substantially (reduction in missing $X_{k^\prime t}^{(i)}$ relative to 
missing $X_{k^\prime t}^{s}$). The number of correctly estimated coefficients increases (in 
terms of assessing statistical significance of the coefficient), and utility increases, in terms of 
$\rho_1$ as well as $J_1$.
