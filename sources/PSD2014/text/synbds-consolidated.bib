  Abstract                 = {We initiate a theoretical study of the census problem. Informally, in a census individual respondents give private information to a trusted party (the census bureau), who publishes a sanitized version of the data. There are two fundamentally conflicting requirements: privacy for the respondents and utility of the sanitized data. Unlike in the study of secure function evaluation, in which privacy is preserved to the extent possible given a specific functionality goal, in the census problem privacy is paramount; intuitively, things that cannot be learned "safely" should not be learned at all. An important contribution of this work is a definition of privacy (and privacy compromise) for statistical databases, together with a method for describing and comparing the privacy offered by specific sanitization techniques.We obtain several privacy results using two different sanitization techniques, and then show how to combine them via cross training. We also obtain two utility results involving clustering.},

This paper presents the authors' views on establishing a research agenda that combines agency needs and potential advantages to respondents and data users. Separately for tabular data and microdata, the disclosure problem is discussed, methods and current practice are reviewed, and an agenda for research is presented. Issues regarding the effects of disclosure limitation on data quality and usefulness are examined. Disclosure limitation methods regarded as superior and suitable for general use are identified and the development and dissemination of corresponding statistical software is recommended.

  Abstract                 = {There are many distinctions between statistical research databases and those arising in commercial or administrative settings, and thus different issues regarding confidentiality and privacy protection on the one hand and and data access and the use of databases on the other. Data integration across multiple databases raises issues in both domains, especially with regard to protection against intruders. This paper highlights some methods developed to limit possible disclosure of confidential information from statistical databases while at the same time publicly releasing sufficient information to allow users, whether dataminers or other more traditional statistical analysts, sufficient data to reach proper statistical conclusions from their analyses. The disclosure limitation tools discussed include: data perturbation and simulation, partial releases, and sampling, with a special focus on partial release of data from multidimensional cross-classifications or contingency tables.},
