  title = {Essays in labor economics and synthetic data methods},
  school = {Cornell University},
  year = {2009},
  type = {Ph.D.},
  abstract = {Three topics are investigated in these chapters: the causes and consequences
	of lateral job mobility within firms, the impact of incentives on
	human behavior in the context of capital punishment and deterrence,
	and the development of new synthetic data methods for confidentiality
	protection of public use data. The extent and importance of lateral
	mobility is not well-established in economics and Chapter 1 contributes
	new and important findings to the literature. Using a panel of more
	than 500 firms and 48,000 white-collar workers, I find relatively
	high rates of lateral mobility, that this mobility is statistically
	different from other transitions, and that the compensation growth
	associated with lateral mobility is economically meaningful. I also
	investigate the relationships between worker performance, compensation
	growth and job mobility. Even when controlling for productivity differences,
	significant earnings growth occurs directly through the change in
	jobs. The results provide some evidence that the observed lateral
	mobility may be the result of job rotation. In light of continued
	debate of whether capital punishment deters crime, Chapter 2 revisits
	my previous work on this issue and shows that the deterrence results
	hold under alternative measurements of key variables, multiple statistical
	specifications and subsets of the data. Chapter 3 develops methodology
	that solves the need for statistical agencies to suppress certain
	data items because releasing those cells to the public yields a risk
	of exposing someone's personal information. I show that the synthetic
	data adequately protect the confidential data and are superior in
	terms of its analytical validity.},

@PHDTHESIS{Stephens2007thesis,
  author = {Bryce Stephens},
  title = {Essays on firm compensation policy and confidentiality protection
	and imputation in the {Q}uarterly {W}orkforce {I}ndicators},
  school = {University of Maryland, College Park},
  year = {2007},
  type = {Ph.D.},
  abstract = {This thesis is comprised of three chapters. The first chapter develops
	a statistical model that enriches the role that firms play in wage
	determination, allowing firms to influence both average wages as
	well as the returns to observable worker characteristics. I exploit
	the hierarchical nature of a unique employer-employee linked dataset
	maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household
	Dynamics Program, estimating a multilevel statistical model of earnings
	that accounts for firm-specific deviations in average wages as well
	as the returns to components of human capital---race, gender, education,
	and experience---while also controlling for person-level heterogeneity
	in earnings. Results suggest that there is significant variation
	in the returns to worker characteristics across firms. First, estimates
	of the parameters of the covariance matrix of firm-specific returns
	are statistically significant. Firms that tend to pay higher average
	wages also tend to pay higher than average returns to worker characteristics;
	firms that tend to reward highly the human capital of men also highly
	reward the human capital of women. Second, the firm-specific returns
	account for roughly 7% of the variation in wages---approximately
	30% of the variation in wages explained by firm-specific intercepts
	alone.
	
	
	The second chapter (joint with John M. Abowd and Lars Vilhuber) and
	third chapter discuss the confidentiality protections and imputation
	of place-of-work in the Quarterly Workforce Indicators produced by
	the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program
	as a part of its Local Employment Dynamics Estimates partnership
	with 37 state Labor Market Information offices. Both chapters provide
	a discussion of methodology as well as assessments of the impact
	of the confidentiality protections and imputation of place-of-work
	on the Quarterly Workforce Indicators public use measures.},
