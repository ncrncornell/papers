So far, the approach was successfully implemented only for a limited number of datasets in the U.S. In this paper, we present the first successful implementation outside the U.S.: the generation of partially synthetic datasets for an establishment panel survey at the German Institute for Employment Research. We describe the whole evolution of the project: from the early discussions concerning variables at risk to the final synthesis. We also present our disclosure risk evaluations and provide some first results on the data utility of the generated datasets. A variance-inflated imputation model is introduced that incorporates additional variability in the model for records that are not sufficiently protected by the standard synthesis.},

  Abstract                 = {\&quot;Providing scientific use files for business surveys is a difficult task. Due to smaller populations, higher sampling rates, and skewed distributions disclosure risks are much higher than for household surveys. Simple measures like coarsening are not sufficient to protect the data. The aim of generating synthetic datasets is to release data that provide a high level of data utility while guaranteeing the confidentiality of the survey respondent. To achieve this, sensitive variables and variables that could be used for re-identification purposes are replaced with multiple imputations. This report gives a short introduction to the topic and discusses some aspects that analysts should keep in mind when using the synthetic datasets. Furthermore, the report describes how valid inferences can be obtained based on the synthetic datasets and provides some first data utility evaluations that indicate the potentials but also the limits of the generated datasets.\&quot; (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))},

To define useful imputation models for a dataset that consists of categorical and of continuous variables with distributions that are anything but normal, contains skip patterns and all sorts of logical constraints is a challenging task.

  Abstract                 = {\&quot;For micro-datasets considered for release as scientific or public use files, statistical agencies have to face the dilemma of guaranteeing the confidentiality of survey respondents on the one hand and offering sufficiently detailed data on the other hand. For that reason a variety of methods to guarantee disclosure control is discussed in the literature. In this paper, we present an application of Rubin's (1993) idea to generate synthetic datasets from existing confidential survey data for public release. We use a set of variables from the 1997 wave of the German IAB Establishment Panel and evaluate the quality of the approach by comparing results from an analysis by Zwick (2005) with the original data with the results we achieve for the same analysis run on the dataset after the imputation procedure. The comparison shows that valid inferences can be obtained using the synthetic datasets in this context, while confidentiality is guaranteed for the survey participants.\&quot; (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))},

  Abstract                 = {\&quot;Economists have long been interested in the determinants and components of job creation and destruction. In many countries administrative datasets provide an excellent source for detailed analysis on a fine and disaggregate level. However, administrative datasets are not without problems: restructuring and relabeling of firms is often poorly measured and can potentially create large biases. We provide evidence of the extent of this bias and provide a new solution to deal with it using the German Establishment History Panel (BHP). While previous research has relied on the first and last appearance of the establishment identifier (EID) to identify openings and closings, we improve on this approach using a new dataset containing all worker flows between establishments in Germany. This allows us to credibly identify establishment births and deaths from 1975 to 2004. We show that the misclassification bias of using only the EID is very severe: Only about 35 to 40 percent of new and disappearing EIDs with more than 3 employees correspond unambiguously to real establishment entries and exits. Among larger establishments misclassification is even more common. We show that many new establishment IDs appear to be 'Spin-Offs' and these have become increasingly more common over time. We then demonstrate that using only EID entries and exits may dramatically overstate, by as much as 100 percent, the role of establishment turnover for job creation and destruction. Furthermore correcting job creation and destruction measures for spurious EID entries and exits reduces these measures and aligns them closer with the business cycle.\&quot; (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))},

  Abstract                 = {In most countries, national statistical agencies do not release establishment-level business microdata, because doing so represents too large a risk to establishments\' confidentiality. One approach with the potential for overcoming these risks is to release synthetic data; that is, the released establishment data are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the distributions of the underlying real microdata. In this article, we describe an application of this strategy to create a public use file for the Longitudinal Business Database, an annual economic census of establishments in the United States comprising more than 20 million records dating back to 1976. The U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Internal Revenue Service recently approved the release of these synthetic microdata for public use, making the synthetic Longitudinal Business Database the first-ever business microdata set publicly released in the United States. We describe how we created the synthetic data, evaluated analytical validity, and assessed disclosure risk.},

First, using all records, the imputer samples m values of the parameters of the imputation model. Second, for each parameter draw, the imputer simulates the missing values for all records n times. From these mn completed datasets, the imputer can analyse or disseminate the appropriate subset of records. We develop methods for interval estimation and significance testing for this approach. Methods are presented in the context of multiple imputation for measurement error.},

Instead, users submit analyses to a remote computer that reports back basic output from the fitted model, such as coefficients and standard errors. To be most useful, this remote server also should provide some way for users to check the fit of their models, without disclosing actual data values. This paper discusses regression diagnostics for remote servers. The proposal is to release synthetic diagnostics?i.e. simulated values of residuals and dependent and independent variables?constructed to mimic the relationships among the real-data residuals and independent variables. Using simulations, it is shown that the proposed synthetic diagnostics can reveal model inadequacies without substantial increase in the risk of disclosures. This approach also can be used to develop remote server diagnostics for generalized linear models.},

  Abstract                 = {Use of microdata is severely hampered in many areas of research. This is in particular true for data from statistical offices. One way to circumvent this problem is to anonymize the data such that both confidentiality is guaranteed and informational content of the data is not to much distorted by the anonymization procedure. However many researchers prefer the use of 'original' data. Therefore in recent years remote access/execution ('Fernrechnen') has become quite popular where the original micro data are used in the statistical analysis but are not available to the researchers. Clearly, this alternative takes more time since program files have to be sent to the statistical office. However, the euphoria for this approach has cooled down a bit since it has become apparent that here also problems of condentiality exist. Most obvious is the fact that residuals cannot be provided. See, for example, Gomatam et al. (2005). However, there are very different kinds of 'disclosures' which are discussed in the paper. The paper also draws attention to the use of saturated models which bear the risk of reproducing confidential tabular data. Analysis of variance is the relevant tool in reproducing magnitude tables whereas the corresponding micro-econometric models can be used to reproduce frequency tables: Logit models give the results in case of a nominal variable and Poisson regression is the approach in case of count data.We also shortly discuss possible disclosure risk in the standard multivariate procedures (factor analysis, principal components, cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling). It is clear from the many examples given in the paper that the remote access/execution option will ask for a large amount of statistical expertise in the statistical office in order to check for disclosure risk. Additionally, there will be a tendency not to provide statistical results to the researcher if critical variables such as region or sector are demanded as regressors in the pr},

Using data from the Census Bureau Business Dynamics Statistics and Longitudinal Business Database, we explore the many issues at the core of this ongoing debate. We find that the relationship between firm size and employment growth is sensitive to these issues. However, our main finding is that once we control for firm age there is no systematic relationship between firm size and growth. Our findings highlight the important role of business startups and young businesses in U.S. job creation.},

Statistical agencies regularly collect data from small areas but are prevented from releasing detailed geographical identifiers in public-use data sets due to disclosure concerns. Alternative data dissemination methods used in practice include releasing summary/aggregate tables, suppressing detailed geographic information in public-use data sets, and accessing restricted data via Research Data Centers. This research examines an alternative method for disseminating microdata that contains more geographical details than are currently being released in public-use data files. Specifically, the method replaces the observed survey values with imputed, or synthetic, values simulated from a hierarchical Bayesian model. Confidentiality protection is enhanced because no actual values are released. The method is demonstrated using restricted data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey. The analytic validity of the synthetic data is assessed by comparing small area estimates obtained from the synthetic data with those obtained from the observed data.},

One particular form of multiscale data arises when data are aggregated across different scales both longitudinally and by economic sector. Frequently, such datasets experience missing observations in a manner that they can be accurately imputed, while respecting the constraints imposed by the multiscale nature of the data, using the method we propose known as Bayesian multiscale multiple imputation. Our approach couples dynamic linear models with a novel imputation step based on singular normal distribution theory. Although our method is of independent interest, one important implication of such methodology is its potential effect on confidential databases protected by means of cell suppression. In order to demonstrate the proposed methodology and to assess the effectiveness of disclosure practices in longitudinal databases, we conduct a large-scale empirical study using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). During the course of our empirical investigation it is determined that several of the predicted cells are within 1% accuracy, thus causing potential concerns for data confidentiality. },

  abstract = {Three topics are investigated in these chapters: the causes and consequences
        of lateral job mobility within firms, the impact of incentives on
        human behavior in the context of capital punishment and deterrence,
        and the development of new synthetic data methods for confidentiality
        protection of public use data. The extent and importance of lateral
        mobility is not well-established in economics and Chapter 1 contributes
        new and important findings to the literature. Using a panel of more
        than 500 firms and 48,000 white-collar workers, I find relatively
        high rates of lateral mobility, that this mobility is statistically
        different from other transitions, and that the compensation growth
        associated with lateral mobility is economically meaningful. I also
        investigate the relationships between worker performance, compensation
        growth and job mobility. Even when controlling for productivity differences,
        significant earnings growth occurs directly through the change in
        jobs. The results provide some evidence that the observed lateral
        mobility may be the result of job rotation. In light of continued
        debate of whether capital punishment deters crime, Chapter 2 revisits
        my previous work on this issue and shows that the deterrence results
        hold under alternative measurements of key variables, multiple statistical
        specifications and subsets of the data. Chapter 3 develops methodology
        that solves the need for statistical agencies to suppress certain
        data items because releasing those cells to the public yields a risk
        of exposing someone's personal information. I show that the synthetic
        data adequately protect the confidential data and are superior in
        terms of its analytical validity.},
