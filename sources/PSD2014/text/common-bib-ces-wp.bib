	be used outside of a secure Census Bureau facility. The Census Bureau
	created version 2 of the SynLBD by synthesizing information on establishments'
	employment and payroll, establishments' birth and death years, and
	industrial classification. The Census Disclosure Review Board and
	their counterparts at IRS have reviewed the content of the file,
	and allowed the release of these data for public use.},
